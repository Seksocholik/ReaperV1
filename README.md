Additional Info:

If you want a custom loader with a different signature to avoid ban waves, it costs $20. If you’d like to add features, improve the system, or upgrade the V1 source, simply open a ticket on Discord.

The loader is packed with a heavy obfuscator, and the source code is protected with PyArmor using the --advanced option, so you won’t be able to view or modify it.

If you don’t want to risk getting banned because this is free software, consider purchasing Reaper V2 or Void, which are fully developed in C++, Rust, and Python.
